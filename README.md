## Create Verifiable Credentials and EAS Attestations with ComposeDB
This directory contains a simple frontend interface, the Ceramic server configurations, and Ceramic client operations required to create, save, and query AccountTrustClaims (using VCs and Attestations) to ComposeDB.

1. Install your dependencies:

Install your dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Generate your admin seed, admin did, and ComposeDB configuration file:

Next, we will need to generate an admin seed and ComposeDB configuration our application will use. This example repository contains a script found at /client/scripts/commands/mjs that generates one for you (preset to run "inmemory" which is ideal for testing).

To generate your necessary credentials, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npm run generate
```

3. Create a new .env file in this client directory. Use the KMS_SECRET_KEY value you generated from the `express-veramo` directory as the SECRET_KEY value for the `client` directory you're currently in

4. Finally, run your application in a new terminal (first ensure you are running node v16 in your terminal):

```bash
nvm use 16
npm run dev
```

If you explore your composedb.config.json and admin_seed.txt files, you will now see a defined JSON ComposeDB server configuration and Ceramic admin seed, respectively.

5. Visit port 3000 in your browser to begin creating both Verifiable Credentials and EAS Attestations while saving them to ComposeDB.
